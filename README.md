# Zulip API Client Library Rust Crate

This repo contains the code for an unofficial, third-party Zulip API client library crate written in the Rust programming language. This library maps Zulip API endpoints into a set of modules that can be used in a Rust project

# Contributing

PR's are welcome including documentation, typo corrections, tests, feedback, etc. There are many endpoints that have not been fully implemented and they can make for great practical learning oppunitunies (aka good first issues)

*please note: I am a beginner in Rust so it may take me some time to review any PR's and provide helpful feedback or insight*

# Attribution

The design of this library was and is inspired by [Octocrab](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/octocrab)
